About
Student Performance Checker is a machine learning-based web application that predicts student performance based on input features such as Hours Studied, 
Previous scores, etc. The project uses a Linear Regression model trained on real student data and is deployed using both Streamlit and FastAPI.

🚀 Features:
🔍 Predicts student performance using Linear Regression
📁 Upload CSV data for testing
🌐 Deployed on Streamlit for interactive UI
⚙️ FastAPI backend for API-based usage
💾 Model saved as .pkl file for reuse
📦 Easy setup using requirements.txt

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib
Streamlit (for UI)
FastAPI (for backend API)
